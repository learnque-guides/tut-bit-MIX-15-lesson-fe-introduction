# Exercise 2

* Create an array variable named `doggies` in your `app.component.ts` file and fill it with similar JS objects that each represent a good doggo.
* Display the names of doggies in the template using the `*ngFor` directive.
* If there are less than 2 objects in the array variable, display the line "Who let the dogs out?"
on the screen using `*ngIf` directive.
* Add a button to the page that triggers a simple alert and print out some woofs!
* If you are up for the challenge, add another button that would add a dog (with any generic
good name) to the list.
