# What is inside the template?

```html
<h1>Title: {{ title }}</h1>
```

* Your app.component.html might look like the example above.
* First of all – it basically parses clean HTML! ☺
* Interpolation – note the {{ }} annotation. Try changing the title variable in the previous file
and see what happens!
* A template combines HTML with Angular markup that can modify HTML elements before they are displayed. Template directives provide program logic, and binding markup connects your application data and the DOM. There are two types of data binding:
  * Event binding lets your application respond to user input in the target environment by updating your application data.
  * Property binding lets you interpolate values that are computed from your application data into the HTML.
* Additional other tags are Angular-specific and are covered in the next slides.
