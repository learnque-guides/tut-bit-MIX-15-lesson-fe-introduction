# Let's play around with bootstrap

Let's set up bootstrap quick start from [template](https://github.com/viktornar/bootsrap-quick-start/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

For the most straightforward development, open two Terminal tabs to execute `npm run server` and `npm run watch` at the same time.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm i

# Compile Sass
npm run css-compile

# Watch Sass for changes (uses nodemon)
npm run watch

# Start local server (uses sirv-cli)
npm run server

# Watches Sass for changes and starts a local server
npm start
```
