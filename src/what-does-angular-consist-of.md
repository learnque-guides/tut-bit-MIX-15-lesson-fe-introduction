# What does Angular consist of?

* Basic building blocks of Angular are NgModules.
* A typical app consists of several logical NgModules. Usual practice being a root module and
several feature modules around it.
* NgModules consist of Components.
* Components define Views (HTML with data injections).
* Components use Services (classes that handle logic and can be injected as dependencies).
* Class separation and binding is done using metadata that defines the associations.
